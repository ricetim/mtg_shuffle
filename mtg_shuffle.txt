Research Paper
	Sigmoid riffle
		Graph on how the sigmoid riffle probability changes with difference in pile sizes
		How did I choose the k value
		why did I choose to implement this function?
			wanted to prevent long streaks, as that doesn't occur in the wild
			can I show how it prevents the streaks?
			would there be a better way to do this?
	"traditional" riffle
		from the 1980's research paper
		produces a lot of streaks, which don't seem to happen in practice
		does produce more random outcomes
